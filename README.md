# Eric Smekens
Hi, I'm Eric, a lead developer at CM.com working on several messaging related products(SMS, Viber, WhatsApp). I live in Dorst, a small village near Breda in the Netherlands. ðŸ™Œ

## My values, explained by my favorite proverbs

ðŸŒ´ No man is an island.<br>
â˜˜ You will never plough a field if you only turn it over in your mind.<br>
ðŸ’– Be kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle.

## How I work

I love it to learn something new, get that elbow grease, and then sharing the problems and knowledge you've found. And after that, piece by piece, no matter how tiny that piece might be, make it more understandable, make it better.

## Projects

Have a look in my repositories down below.

#### ðŸš— obd projects

Part of my graduation internship. It perfectly describes the way `how I like to work`. Learning obd and node.js at the same time, and making something that is shareable to the rest of the community. It is definitely not the best package out there, but it is still a place of shareable information.

#### âœ” jsep

Used this as a dependency in my first job. Spent some free time on it, to learn more and try to extend it. Eventually became a collaborator, and now the maintainer of the package. Thanks to the original author as well for the great work.
